# Hello Cargo!
An initial introduction to Rust with Cargo
[Link to Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html)

## Some Key Commands
- `cargo new <project_name>` will create a new project skeleton
- `cargo build` run in the project root will compile and build the project in debug mode
- `cargo build --release` run in the project root will compile and build the project in release mode
- `cargo check` will check project's ability to compile (much faster cuz no executable)
- `cargo check --release` will do the same as above in release mode
- `cargo run` and `cargo run --release` will run the project in debug/release mode
